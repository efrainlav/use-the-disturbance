## Abstract

The gravity anomaly has long been used by geophysicists for 
representing the gravitational effect produced by gravity
sources.This quantity, however, can be used in this way as a good
approximation. Rigorously, the gravitational effect produced by the sources
is represented by the gravity disturbance, which is a well-known 
quantity in geodesy.
In this paper, we discuss the fundamental concepts supporting 
the fact that gravity disturbance is the more appropriated quantity
to be used for estimating density variations related to geological
bodies in subsurface. We stress that almost all authors in the 
literature have implicitly used the gravity anomaly as an approximation 
of the gravity disturbance, which can be represented by a harmonic 
function and, consequently, satisfies the premise behind most of 
the interpretation techniques used in geophysics (e.g., 
upward/downward continuation, 
data processing with equivalent layer,
conversions between gravity and magnetic data,
computation of vertical derivatives via Fourier and Hilbert
transforms).
Although the gravity anomaly can be considered a good approximation of the 
gravity disturbance for most practical applications, 
it is important to bear in mind not only the terminology 
changes, but also the conceptual assumptions.
