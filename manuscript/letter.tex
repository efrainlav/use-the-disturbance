\section{Introduction}

The resultant of gravitational force and centrifugal force acting 
on a body at rest on the Earth's surface is called 
\textit{gravity vector} and its intensity is called 
\textit{gravity} \citep{heiskanen-moritz1967,
hofmann-wellenhof-moritz2005}.
In the case of gravimetry on moving platforms (e.g., airplanes,
helicopters, marine vessels), there are additional
non-gravitational accelerations due to the vehicle motion, 
such as Coriolis acceleration and high-frequency vibrations 
\citep{glennie-etal2000,nabighian-etal2005-grav,baumann-etal2012}.
Geophysicists use gravity for estimating the Earth's 
internal density distribution whereas geodesists use
gravity to estimate the geoid \citep{li2001}.
Hence, geophysicists are usually interested 
in the gravitational component of the observed gravity, 
which is produced by the Earth's internal 
density distribution.

The first step of the procedure for isolating this 
gravitational component consists in removing the non-gravitational 
effects due to the vehicle motion and also the time variations 
such as Earth tides, instrumental drift and barometric 
pressure changes, for example.
If these effects are properly removed, the resultant 
gravity data can be considered as the sum of a 
centrifugal component due to the Earth's rotation and
a gravitational component produced by the whole Earth's
internal density distribution.
The isolation of this particular gravitational component 
and its subsequent use for estimating density 
distributions related to geological structures in subsurface 
are the main goals in applied geophysics \citep{blakely1996}.
The computation of the gravitational effect produced by
the geological structures is commonly known in geophysics as 
\textit{gravity modeling}.
This term is different from \textit{gravity field modeling}, which
is commonly used in geodesy to denote the characterization of the 
gravity field in a local, regional or global scale.

Based on well-established concepts of the literature,
we present a discussion aiming at bringing some
light to the following question: in geophysical applications,
should we use the gravity disturbance or gravity anomaly?
It seems that this theoretical issue has been 
debated within the scientific community from a 
more geodetic than geophysical point of view
\citep{lafehr1991,chapin1996,li2001,fairhead2003,
hackney-featherstone2003,hinze2005}.
Our reasoning suggests that the gravity 
disturbance is more appropriated than the gravity anomaly 
for geophysical purposes.


\section{Normal Earth and normal gravity}

Traditionally, the Earth's gravity field is approximated 
by the gravity field produced by a reference ellipsoid
(or level ellipsoid), which is rigid and geocentric.
This reference ellipsoid has the minor axis $b$ 
coincident with the mean rotating axis of the Earth $Z$, the 
same total mass (including the atmosphere) and also the
same angular velocity of the Earth \citep{heiskanen-moritz1967,
vanicek1987,hofmann-wellenhof-moritz2005,torge2012}.
Another characteristic of this model is that its
limiting surface coincides with a particular equipotential 
of its own gravity field.
Here, we follow \citep{torge2012} and call this model as
\textit{normal Earth}.

Similarly to the gravity vector and gravity, 
the resultant of the virtual 
gravitational and centrifugal forces exerted by the normal
Earth on a body at rest at a point $P$ is called 
\textit{normal gravity vector} and its intensity is called 
\textit{normal gravity}.
In geodesy, any model used to represent the normal gravity field
can be arbitrarily defined for the only purpose
of keeping the difference from the actual gravity field as small 
as possible \citep{vanicek1987}.

It is worth noting that, although the normal Earth has the
same total mass (including the atmosphere) of the Earth,
its internal density distribution is unknown.
The search for physically meaningful mass distributions 
that generate a required normal gravity field
has geophysical rather than geodetic motives \citep{marussi1974}.
The only condition imposed on its internal density
distribution is that it produces a gravity field
having a particular equipotential which coincides
with its limiting surface.
For convenience, we denote any density distribution 
satisfying this condition as a \textit{normal density distribution}.


\section{Terrestrial Reference Systems used in gravity modeling}

For geophysical purposes, there are three important Terrestrial Reference Systems used in gravity modeling. 
They rotate with the Earth and are used for describing
positions and movements of objects on and close to the Earthâ€™s surface
\citep{torge2012}.

The first one is a geocentric system of Cartesian coordinates having 
the $Z$-axis coincident with the mean Earth's rotational axis,
the $X$-axis pointing to the Greenwich meridian and the $Y$-axis
directed so as to obtain a right-handed system (Figure \ref{fig:GCS-GGS}).
This reference system can be found in the literature with different names: Mean Terrestrial System \citep[e.g.,][]{soler1976}, Earth-fixed geocentric Cartesian system \citep[e.g.,][]{torge2012} 
or Earth-centered Earth-fixed system \citep[e.g.,][]{bouman_etal2013}, for example. Here, we opted for simply using the term Geocentric Cartesian System (GCS).

Other important reference system is a geocentric system of 
geodetic coordinates, which is defined by the reference ellipsoid 
used in the Normal Earth model \citep{heiskanen-moritz1967, soler1976, 
torge2012, bouman_etal2013}. 
In this coordinate system, the position of a point 
is defined by the \textit{geometric height} $h$, 
\textit{geodetic latitude} $\varphi$ and \textit{longitude} $\lambda$ (Figure \ref{fig:GCS-GGS}).
For convenience, we call this system Geocentric Geodetic System
(GGS). 
At a given point $(h, \varphi, \lambda)$, there are three 
mutually-orthogonal unit vectors (Figure \ref{fig:GCS-GGS}) given by \citep{soler1976}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\hat{\mitbf{u}} &= 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\varphi \, \cos\lambda \\
\cos\varphi \, \sin\lambda \\
\sin\varphi
\end{bmatrix} \\
\hat{\mitbf{v}} &= 
\begin{bmatrix}
-\sin\varphi \, \cos\lambda \\
-\sin\varphi \, \sin\lambda \\
\cos\varphi
\end{bmatrix} \\
\hat{\mitbf{w}} &= 
\begin{bmatrix}
-\sin\lambda \\
\cos\lambda \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{split} \: .
\label{eq:unit-vectors}
\end{equation}
The required equations to convert coordinates $(h, \varphi, 
\lambda)$ referred to the GGS into coordinates $(X, Y, Z)$ referred to 
the GCS (Figure \ref{fig:GCS-GGS}) and vice versa can be easily found in 
the literature \citep[e.g.,][]{heiskanen-moritz1967, torge2012, 
bouman_etal2013}.

In a local or regional study, geophysicists commonly use a topocentric 
Cartesian coordinate system (TCS) with origin at a point $P$ on or 
close to the Earth's surface and axes $x$, $y$ and $z$ (Figure 
\ref{fig:TCS}). In the TCS, the axes $x$ and $y$ are parallel to 
the unit vectors $\hat{\mitbf{v}}_{P}$ $\hat{\mitbf{w}}_{P}$, respectively,
whereas the $z$-axis is opposite to the unit vector 
$\hat{\mitbf{u}}_{P}$ (equation \ref{eq:unit-vectors}) and points downward.

Consider a TCS (Figure \ref{fig:TCS}) with origin at a point $P$ with
coordinates $(X_{P}, Y_{P}, Z_{P})$ referred to the GCS (Figure \ref{fig:GCS-GGS}).
In this case, the relationship between the coordinates $(X, Y, Z)$ of a 
point in the GCS and the coordinates $(x, y, z)$ of the same point in the 
TCS is given by:
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
z 
\end{bmatrix} =
\mitbf{R}^{\top} \begin{bmatrix}
X - X_{P} \\
Y - Y_{P} \\
Z - Z_{P}
\end{bmatrix} \: ,
\label{eq:GCS2TCS}
\end{equation}
where $\mitbf{R}$ is an orthogonal matrix whose columns
are defined by the unit vectors $\hat{\mitbf{u}}$, $\hat{\mitbf{v}}$ and
$\hat{\mitbf{w}}$ (equation \ref{eq:unit-vectors}) as follows:
\begin{equation}
\mitbf{R} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{\mitbf{v}} & \hat{\mitbf{w}} & -\hat{\mitbf{u}}
\end{bmatrix} \: .
\label{eq:R}
\end{equation}


\section{Anomalous quantities in gravity modeling}

Let $\mitbf{g}_{P}$ and $\mitbf{\gamma}_{P}$ be, respectively, the 
gravity vector (corrected from non-gravitational effects due to vehicle 
motion and time variations such as Earth tides, instrumental drift and 
barometric pressure changes, for example) and the normal gravity vector 
at a point $P$. The difference between these two vectors, at the same 
point $P$, defines a quantity called \textit{gravity disturbance 
vector}, which is given by:
\begin{equation}
\delta \mitbf{g}_{P} = 
\mitbf{g}_{P} - \mitbf{\gamma}_{P} \: .
\label{eq:gravity-disturbance-vector}
\end{equation}
By definition, the centrifugal component of the normal gravity vector 
is equal to the centrifugal component of the gravity vector if they 
are evaluated at the same point.
Then, the gravity disturbance vector $\delta \mitbf{g}_{P}$ represents 
a purely gravitational (and consequently harmonic) quantity, which is 
caused by contrasts between the actual internal 
density distribution of the Earth and the (unknown) internal density 
distribution of the normal Earth.
In applied geophysics, these density differences are generally 
called \textit{anomalous masses} (e.g., \citeauthor{hammer1945}, 
\citeyear{hammer1945}; \citeauthor{lafehr1965}, \citeyear{lafehr1965}),
\textit{density anomalies} (e.g., \citeauthor{forsberg1984}, 
\citeyear{forsberg1984}) or \textit{gravity sources} (e.g., 
\citeauthor{blakely1996}, \citeyear{blakely1996}). Here, we opted for 
using the last term.
Figure \ref{fig:surfaces} illustrates the gravity vector 
$\mitbf{g}_{P}$, normal gravity vector $\mitbf{\gamma}_{P}$ and 
the gravity disturbance vector $\delta \mitbf{g}_{P}$ at a point $P$ 
located on the Earth's surface.

The difference between the gravity $g_{P}$ and the normal gravity 
$\gamma_{P}$, at the same point $P$, is called \textit{gravity 
disturbance} \citep{heiskanen-moritz1967, hofmann-wellenhof-moritz2005} 
and can be represented as follows:
\begin{equation}
\delta g_{P} = g_{P} - \gamma_{P} \: .
\label{eq:gravity-disturbance}
\end{equation}
Notice that the gravity disturbance $\delta g_{P}$ is not equivalent 
to the magnitude of the gravity disturbance vector 
$\delta \mitbf{g}_{P}$ \citep{barthelmes2013, sanso_sideris2013}.
As properly pointed out by \citet{hackney-featherstone2003},
the gravity disturbance is a very-well established quantity in geodesy,
but appears to be less well known in geophysics.

The gravity anomaly is the commonly used quantity in applied 
geophysics. It is defined as the difference
between the gravity on the geoid and the normal gravity on the ellipsoid,
both at the same geodetic latitude and longitude.
Notice that, by definition, the gravity anomaly depends on 
longitude and latitude only and is not a function in space 
\citep{barthelmes2013}.
Different gravity anomalies can be calculated, depending on the
corrections applied to them \citep{blakely1996, hofmann-wellenhof-moritz2005}.
These corrections are usually called gravity reductions.
For example, the Free-air anomaly is an approximation of the
gravity disturbance whereas the Bouguer anomaly
is an approximation of the terrain corrected gravity disturbance.
The last one is commonly used by geophysicists as the
gravitational effect produced by the gravity sources.
Although this approximation is valid for most practical applications,
it is important to bear in mind not only the terminology 
changes, but also the conceptual assumptions.

There was a certain lack of comprehension regarding the
geophysical meaning of gravity anomalies until the
mid 90's.
As properly pointed out by \citet{chapin1996} at that time, 
``although the corrections which bring about a Bouguer 
gravity anomaly are well established, the reasons for doing
them are not well understood. One cause of this common 
misunderstanding is that the subject has been poorly presented in
many of the basic texts".
In his seminal book, \citet{blakely1996} brought some light
on the geophysical meaning of gravity anomalies from the 
perspective of applied geophysics. \citet{blakely1996} correctly
defined gravity sources as density contrasts between the actual
internal density distribution of the Earth and the internal density
distribution of the normal Earth.
However, he did not stress that, by removing the normal gravity 
evaluated on the ellipsoid from the gravity measured 
on the Earth's surface, the remaining disturbing field will reflect 
not only the effect produced by the gravity sources, but also a
small combination of gravitational and centrifugal effects.
This additional, non-harmonic and undesired effect is 
simply due to the calculation of the normal gravity at a point
other than that were the gravity is measured.


\section{Mathematical description of the gravity disturbance in a local coordinate system}


In this coordinate system, the observed gravity vector
$\mitbf{g}_{i}$, at a point $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$, 
$i = 1, ..., N$, can be represented by
\begin{equation}
\mitbf{g}_{i} = \mitbf{\gamma}_{i} + \Delta \mitbf{g}_{i} \: ,
\label{eq:gravity-vector}
\end{equation}
where $\mitbf{\gamma}_{i}$ and $\Delta \mitbf{g}_{i}$
are, respectively, the normal gravity vector and a
disturbing gravitational attraction produced by the anomalous 
masses at the point $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$.

For each point $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$ in the topocentric
Cartesian coordinate system (Figure \ref{fig:TCS}b), there is
a corresponding point $(h_{i}, \varphi_{i}, \lambda_{i})$
in the geodetic coordinate system (Figure \ref{fig:GCS-GGS}).


By definition, the gravity disturbance $\delta g_{i}$,
at the point $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$, is given by 
\citep{heiskanen-moritz1967, hofmann-wellenhof-moritz2005}:
\begin{equation}
\delta g_{i} =  g_{i} - \gamma_{i} \: ,
\label{eq:gravity-disturbance}
\end{equation}
where $g_{i} = \| \mitbf{g}_{i} \|$ and 
$\gamma_{i} = \| \mitbf{\gamma}_{i} \|$ are,
respectively, the observed gravity and the normal gravity at the
point $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$.
Fortunately, the condition 
$\gamma_{i} \gg \| \Delta \mathbf{g}_{i} \|$ 
is met at all points located above or on the Earth's surface.
By combining this condition and the definition of observed gravity vector
(equation \ref{eq:gravity-vector}), we can approximate the observed gravity
$g_{i}$ by a first order Taylor's expansion as follows 
\citep{sanso_sideris2013}:
\begin{equation}
g_{i} \approx \gamma_{i} + 
\hat{\mitbf{\gamma}}_{i}^{\top} \Delta \mitbf{g}_{i} \: ,
\label{eq:gobs-approx}
\end{equation}
where $^{\top}$ denotes transposition,
$\hat{\mitbf{\gamma}}_{i} = -\hat{\mitbf{u}}_{i}$ is a unit 
vector with the same direction as the normal gravity vector 
$\mitbf{\gamma}_{i}$ at the point $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$, in the
topocentric Cartesian coordinate system (Figure \ref{fig:TCS}b), and
$\hat{\mitbf{u}}_{i}$ is the unit vector $\hat{\mitbf{u}}$ 
(equation \ref{eq:unit-vectors}) evaluated at the corresponding 
point $(h_{i}, \varphi_{i}, \lambda_{i})$ in the 
geodetic coordinate system (Figure \ref{fig:GCS-GGS}).

This approximation, which is known in geodesy \citep[e.g.,][]{sanso_sideris2013},
is largely used in applied geophysics for representing
total-field anomalies \citep[e.g.,][]{blakely1996}.
Notice that, in local- or regional-gravity studies, the unit
vector $\hat{\mitbf{\gamma}}_{i}$ (equation \ref{eq:gobs-approx}) 
may be considered constant throughout the study area and 
parallel to the $z$ axis of the topocentric Cartesian coordinate 
system (Figure \ref{fig:TCS}b).
Consequently, by using the approximation defined in equation 
\ref{eq:gobs-approx}, the gravity disturbance 
(equation \ref{eq:gravity-disturbance}) can be rewritten as 
follows 
\begin{equation}
\delta g_{i} \approx \hat{\mitbf{\gamma}}_{P}^{\top} \Delta \mitbf{g}_{i} \: ,
\label{eq:gravity-disturbance-approx}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\mitbf{\gamma}}_{P}$ represents the unit vector with
the same direction as the normal gravity vector $\mitbf{\gamma}_{P}$
at the origin $P$ of the topocentric Cartesian coordinate system
(Figure \ref{fig:TCS}).
This equation shows that the gravity disturbance $\delta g_{i}$ (equation \ref{eq:gravity-disturbance}) is different from the magnitude
of the disturbing gravitational attraction $\Delta \mitbf{g}_{i}$
produced by the gravity sources. Rather, it represents the 
component of the $\Delta \mitbf{g}_{i}$ on the direction of the normal
gravity vector. In the topocentric Cartesian coordinate system,
the gravity disturbance $\delta g_{i}$ (equation \ref{eq:gravity-disturbance-approx})
can be defined as the vertical component of the gravitational attraction exerted by
the gravity sources at the point $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$.
As a consequence, the gravity disturbance produced by
a homogeneous gravity source with density contrast $\Delta\rho$
(in $kg / m^{3}$) can be represented by the following harmonic function:
\begin{equation}
d_{i} = k_{g} \, G \, \Delta\rho \, \partial_{z} \phi_{i} \: ,
\label{eq:gz-local}
\end{equation}
where $G$ is the Newtonian constant of gravitation
(in $m^{3} / (kg \, s^{2})$),
$k_{g} = 10^{5}$ is a constant factor
transforming from $m/s^{2}$ to milligal (mGal),
and $\partial_{z} \phi_{i}$ is a harmonic function representing the first 
derivative, evaluated at the observation point $(x_{i},y_{i},z_{i})$, 
$i = 1, ..., N$, of the function 
\begin{equation}
\phi(x,y,z) = \int\int\limits_{v}\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{(x - x^{\prime})^{2} + 
(y - y^{\prime})^{2} + (z - z^{\prime})^{2}}} \: dv
\label{eq:phi}
\end{equation}
with respect to the variable $z$. The 
integral is conducted over the coordinates $x^{\prime}$, $y^{\prime}$ 
and $z^{\prime}$ within the volume $v$ of the gravity source.
This equation can be easily generalized for the case
of multiple gravity sources.

Practically all the literature about gravity modeling
use the quantity $d_{i}$ (equation \ref{eq:gz-local})
to represent the gravity anomaly produced by 
gravity sources \citep[e.g.,][]{blakely1996}. 
Consequently, almost all the geophysicists use the gravity
anomaly as an approximation of the gravity disturbance
produced by the gravity sources. Notice that $d_{i}$ 
(equation \ref{eq:gz-local}) does not depend on the
geoidal surface. Rather, it depends on the relative position 
of the observation points $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$ with respect to
the gravity sources in a topocentric Cartesian coordinate
system (Figure \ref{fig:TCS}b).


\section{Conclusions}

We debate the conceptual differences between the gravity
disturbance and the gravity anomaly.
Our reasoning suggest that the gravity disturbance is the
more appropriated quantity for representing the gravity
effect produced by the gravity sources.
In summary, we point out that:

\begin{enumerate}
%\renewcommand{\theenumi}{(\arabic{enumi})}
\renewcommand{\theenumii}{\alph{enumii}}

\item Almost all interpretation techniques assume, implicitly or
directly, that the gravity data is harmonic (e.g., 
upward/downward continuation, 
data processing with equivalent layer,
conversions between gravity and magnetic data,
computation of vertical derivatives via Fourier and Hilbert
transforms). As a consequence, they implicitly or directly assume that
the gravity data approximates the gravitational disturbance.

\item Almost all forward modeling techniques compute
the vertical component of the gravitational attraction 
exerted by the geological bodies at the observation points.
Notice that the gravity anomaly requires the computation of gravity
on the Geoid, which is generally within the topographic masses.
Hence, almost all geophysicists implicitly compute 
the gravity disturbance.

\item The gravity anomaly is defined as the difference between 
the gravity on the Geoid and the normal gravity on the reference 
ellipsoid, both at the same geodetic latitude and longitude.
Consequently, the gravity anomaly is a function of
the geodetic latitude and longitude only and cannot
be calculated at arbitrary heights. On the other hand,
the gravity disturbance can be computed at arbitrary points
outside the sources.

\end{enumerate}

The principal theoretical implication of this study is that
is that, although the gravity anomaly may be used as a good approximation of
the gravity effect produced by the sources for most practical applications,
the more appropriated quantity for gravity modeling is the
gravity disturbance. We stress that, more important than the 
the terminology changes, the geophysicist must bear in mind the 
conceptual assumptions used in gravity modeling.
