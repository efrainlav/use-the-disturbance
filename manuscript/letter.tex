\begin{summary}
 The gravity anomaly has long been used by geophysicists for
 representing the gravitational effect produced by gravity
 sources. This quantity, however, can be used in this way as a good
 approximation. Rigorously, the gravitational effect produced by the sources
 is represented by the gravity disturbance, which is a well-known
 quantity in geodesy.
 In this paper, we discuss the fundamental concepts supporting
 the fact that gravity disturbance is the more appropriated quantity
 to be used for estimating density variations related to geological
 bodies in subsurface. We show that the maximum absolute difference
 between the gravity disturbance and the Free-air anomaly in Brazil
 reaches a maximum absolute value of $\approx 9.3$ mGal. We also stress
 that almost all authors in the literature have implicitly used the
 gravity anomaly as an approximation of the gravity disturbance,
 which can be represented by a harmonic function and, consequently,
 satisfies the premise behind most of
 the interpretation techniques used in geophysics (e.g.,
 upward/downward continuation, data processing with equivalent layer,
 conversions between gravity and magnetic data, computation of vertical
 derivatives via Fourier and Hilbert transforms).
 Although the gravity anomaly can be considered a good approximation of the
 gravity disturbance for most practical applications,
 it is important to bear in mind not only the terminology
 changes, but also the conceptual assumptions.

\section{Introduction}

The \textit{gravity vector} is the sum of the gravitational and centrifugal
accelerations felt by a body at rest on the Earth's surface.
Its intensity is what is geoscientists call \textit{gravity}
\citep{heiskanen-moritz1967, hofmann-wellenhof-moritz2005}.
When measured on moving platforms (e.g., airplanes,
helicopters, marine vessels), there are additional
non-gravitational accelerations due to the vehicle motion,
such as Coriolis acceleration and high-frequency vibrations
\citep{glennie-etal2000,nabighian-etal2005-grav,baumann-etal2012}.
Geodesists use gravity measurements to estimate the Geoid \citep{li2001}
whereas geophysicists use gravity to estimate the Earth's
internal density distribution.
Hence, geophysicists are usually only interested
in the gravitational component of the observed gravity
because it is the part that reflects the Earth's internal density distribution.

The first step toward isolating the gravitational component
is to remove the effects of vehicle motion, Earth tides, instrumental drift,
and barometric pressure changes, among others.
If these effects are properly removed, the resultant
observations can be considered to be solely the sum of the
centrifugal acceleration due to the Earth's rotation and
the gravitational acceleration produced by
the internal density distribution of the whole Earth.
The isolation of this particular gravitational component
and its subsequent use for estimating density
distributions related to geological structures in subsurface
are the main goals of applied gravimetry \citep{blakely1996}.
The computation of the gravitational effect produced by
the geological structures is commonly known in geophysics as
\textit{gravity modelling}.
This term is different from \textit{gravity field modelling}, which
is commonly used in geodesy to denote the mathematical characterization of the
gravity field in local, regional, or global scales (e.g., spherical harmonic
analysis).

We present a discussion with the aim of shedding some light on the question:
\textit{should we use the gravity disturbance or gravity anomaly in geophysical
applications}?
The concepts discussed here are well-established in the literature.
However, the debate around this theoretical issue has been
carried about from a more geodetic than a geophysical point of view
\citep{lafehr1991,chapin1996,li2001,fairhead2003,
hackney-featherstone2003,hinze2005}.
Our reasoning suggests that the gravity disturbance is more appropriated for
geophysical purposes than the gravity anomaly.


\section{Normal Earth and normal gravity}

Traditionally, the Earth's gravity field is approximated
by the gravity field produced by a reference ellipsoid
(or level ellipsoid), which is rigid and geocentric.
This reference ellipsoid has the minor axis $b$
coincident with the mean rotating axis of the Earth $Z$, the
same total mass (including the atmosphere) and also the
same angular velocity of the Earth \citep{heiskanen-moritz1967,
vanicek1987,hofmann-wellenhof-moritz2005,torge2012}.
Another characteristic of this model is that its
limiting surface coincides with a particular equipotential
of its own gravity field.
Here, we follow \citep{torge2012} and call this model as
\textit{normal Earth}.

Similarly to the gravity vector and gravity,
the resultant of the virtual
gravitational and centrifugal forces exerted by the normal
Earth on a body at rest at a point $P$ is called
\textit{normal gravity vector} and its intensity is called
\textit{normal gravity}.
In geodesy, any model used to represent the normal gravity field
can be arbitrarily defined for the only purpose
of keeping the difference from the actual gravity field as small
as possible \citep{vanicek1987}.

It is worth noting that, although the normal Earth has the
same total mass (including the atmosphere) of the Earth,
its internal density distribution is unknown.
The search for physically meaningful mass distributions
that generate a required normal gravity field
has geophysical rather than geodetic motives \citep{marussi1974}.
The only condition imposed on its internal density
distribution is that it produces a gravity field
having a particular equipotential which coincides
with its limiting surface.
For convenience, we denote any density distribution
satisfying this condition as a \textit{normal density distribution}.


\section{Terrestrial Reference Systems used in gravity modelling}

For geophysical purposes, there are three important Terrestrial Reference Systems used in gravity modelling.
They rotate with the Earth and are used for describing
positions and movements of objects on and close to the Earthâ€™s surface
\citep{torge2012}.

The first one is a geocentric system of Cartesian coordinates having
the $Z$-axis coincident with the mean Earth's rotational axis,
the $X$-axis pointing to the Greenwich meridian and the $Y$-axis
directed so as to obtain a right-handed system (Fig. \ref{fig:GCS-GGS}).
This reference system can be found in the literature with different names: Mean Terrestrial System \citep[e.g.,][]{soler1976}, Earth-fixed geocentric Cartesian system \citep[e.g.,][]{torge2012}
or Earth-centered Earth-fixed system \citep[e.g.,][]{bouman_etal2013}, for example. Here, we opted for simply using the term Geocentric Cartesian System (GCS).

Another important reference system is a geocentric system of
geodetic coordinates, which is defined by the reference ellipsoid
used in the Normal Earth model \citep{heiskanen-moritz1967, soler1976,
torge2012, bouman_etal2013}.
In this coordinate system, the position of a point
is defined by the \textit{geometric height} $h$,
\textit{geodetic latitude} $\varphi$ and \textit{longitude} $\lambda$ (Fig. \ref{fig:GCS-GGS}).
For convenience, we call this system Geocentric Geodetic System
(GGS).
At a given point $(h, \varphi, \lambda)$, there are three
mutually-orthogonal unit vectors (Fig. \ref{fig:GCS-GGS}) given by \citep{soler1976}:
\begin{equation}
\hat{\mitbf{u}} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\varphi \, \cos\lambda \\
\cos\varphi \, \sin\lambda \\
\sin\varphi
\end{bmatrix}
\hat{\mitbf{v}} =
\begin{bmatrix}
-\sin\varphi \, \cos\lambda \\
-\sin\varphi \, \sin\lambda \\
\cos\varphi
\end{bmatrix}
\hat{\mitbf{w}} =
\begin{bmatrix}
-\sin\lambda \\
\cos\lambda \\
0
\end{bmatrix} .
\label{eq:unit-vectors}
\end{equation}
The required equations to convert coordinates $(h, \varphi,
\lambda)$ referred to the GGS into coordinates $(X, Y, Z)$ referred to
the GCS (Fig. \ref{fig:GCS-GGS}) and vice versa can be easily found in
the literature \citep[e.g.,][]{heiskanen-moritz1967, torge2012,
bouman_etal2013}.

In a local or regional study, geophysicists commonly use a topocentric
Cartesian coordinate system (TCS) with origin at a point $P$ on or
close to the Earth's surface and axes $x$, $y$ and $z$ (Fig.
\ref{fig:TCS}). In the TCS, the axes $x$ and $y$ are parallel to
the unit vectors $\hat{\mitbf{v}}_{P}$ $\hat{\mitbf{w}}_{P}$, respectively,
whereas the $z$-axis is opposite to the unit vector
$\hat{\mitbf{u}}_{P}$ (eq. \ref{eq:unit-vectors}) and points downward.
Consider, for example, a TCS (Fig. \ref{fig:TCS}) with origin at a point $P$ with
coordinates $(X_{P}, Y_{P}, Z_{P})$ referred to the GCS (Fig. \ref{fig:GCS-GGS}).
In this case, the relationship between the coordinates $(X, Y, Z)$ of a
point in the GCS and the coordinates $(x, y, z)$ of the same point in the
TCS is given by:
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
z
\end{bmatrix} =
\mitbf{R}^{\top} \begin{bmatrix}
X - X_{P} \\
Y - Y_{P} \\
Z - Z_{P}
\end{bmatrix} \: ,
\label{eq:GCS2TCS}
\end{equation}
where $\mitbf{R}$ is an orthogonal matrix whose columns
are defined by the unit vectors $\hat{\mitbf{u}}$, $\hat{\mitbf{v}}$ and
$\hat{\mitbf{w}}$ (eq. \ref{eq:unit-vectors}), evaluated at the
point $P$, as follows:
\begin{equation}
\mitbf{R} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{\mitbf{v}} & \hat{\mitbf{w}} & -\hat{\mitbf{u}}
\end{bmatrix} \: .
\label{eq:R}
\end{equation}


\section{Relationship between gravity disturbance and gravity anomaly}

Let $\mitbf{g}_{P}$ and $\mitbf{\gamma}_{P}$ be, respectively, the
gravity vector (corrected from non-gravitational effects due to vehicle
motion and time variations such as Earth tides, instrumental drift and
barometric pressure changes, for instance) and the normal gravity vector
at a point $P$.
In this case, the gravity vector $\mitbf{g}_{P}$ represents the
gradient of a scalar potential called \textit{gravity potential},
which is the sum of a scalar gravitational potential and a
scalar centrifugal potential.
Similarly, the normal gravity vector $\mitbf{\gamma}_{P}$ represents the
gradient of a scalar potential called \textit{normal potential},
which is also the sum of a scalar gravitational potential and a
scalar centrifugal potential.
By definition, the centrifugal part of the normal potential is equal
to that of the gravity potential.
Then, the both gravity vector and normal gravity vectors are represented
by the sum of two vectors: the gradient of a gravitational potential and
the gradient of a centrifugal potential. Notice that, as the centrifugal
part of the gravity potential and normal potential are the same, the
centrifugal part of the gravity vector and normal gravity vector are
also equal to each other.

The difference between $\mitbf{g}_{P}$ and $\mitbf{\gamma}_{P}$, at the same
point $P$, defines a quantity called \textit{gravity disturbance
vector}, which is given by:
\begin{equation}
\delta \mitbf{g}_{P} =
\mitbf{g}_{P} - \mitbf{\gamma}_{P} \: .
\label{eq:gravity-disturbance-vector}
\end{equation}
As the centrifugal part of the normal gravity vector
is equal to the centrifugal component of the gravity vector,
the gravity disturbance vector $\delta \mitbf{g}_{P}$ represents
a purely gravitational (and consequently harmonic) quantity, which is
caused by contrasts between the actual internal
density distribution of the Earth and the (unknown) internal density
distribution of the normal Earth.
In applied geophysics, these density differences are generally
called \textit{anomalous masses} (e.g., \citeauthor{hammer1945},
\citeyear{hammer1945}; \citeauthor{lafehr1965}, \citeyear{lafehr1965}),
\textit{density anomalies} (e.g., \citeauthor{forsberg1984},
\citeyear{forsberg1984}) or \textit{gravity sources} (e.g.,
\citeauthor{blakely1996}, \citeyear{blakely1996}). Here, we opted for
using the last term.
Fig. \ref{fig:surfaces} illustrates the gravity vector
$\mitbf{g}_{P}$, normal gravity vector $\mitbf{\gamma}_{P}$ and
the gravity disturbance vector $\delta \mitbf{g}_{P}$ at a point $P$
located on the Earth's surface.

The difference between gravity $g_{P}$ (magnitude of the gravity
vector $\mitbf{g}_{P}$) and normal gravity $\gamma_{P}$
(magnitude of the normal gravity vector $\mitbf{\gamma}_{P}$), at the
same point $P$, is called \textit{gravity disturbance}
\citep{heiskanen-moritz1967, hofmann-wellenhof-moritz2005}
and can be represented as follows:
\begin{equation}
\delta g_{P} = g_{P} - \gamma_{P} \: ,
\label{eq:gravity-disturbance}
\end{equation}
where $g_{P} = \| \mitbf{g}_{P} \|$ and
$\gamma_{P} = \| \mitbf{\gamma}_{P} \|$ are,
respectively, the gravity and the normal gravity at the
point $P$.
Notice that the gravity disturbance $\delta g_{P}$ is not equivalent
to the magnitude of the gravity disturbance vector
$\delta \mitbf{g}_{P}$ \citep{barthelmes2013, sanso_sideris2013}.
As properly pointed out by \citet{hackney-featherstone2003},
the gravity disturbance is a very-well established quantity in geodesy,
but appears to be less well known in geophysics.

Another anomalous quantity is the \textit{gravity anomaly vector}.
It is defined, at point $P$, as the difference between the gravity
vector at a point $Q^{\prime}$ on the Geoid (a particular
equipotential surface of the gravity potential) and the normal
gravity vector at a point $Q$ on the ellipsoid surface, both at the
same geodetic latitude and longitude (Fig. \ref{fig:surfaces}) as in
\begin{equation}
\Delta \mitbf{g}_{P} = \mitbf{g}_{Q^{\prime}} - \mitbf{\gamma}_{Q} .
\label{eq:gravity-anomaly-vector}
\end{equation}
Similarly to the gravity disturbance expression (eq.
\ref{eq:gravity-disturbance}), the gravity anomaly is given by
\begin{equation}
\Delta g_{P} = g_{Q^{\prime}} - \gamma_{Q} ,
\label{eq:gravity-anomaly}
\end{equation}
where $g_{Q^{\prime} } = \| \mitbf{g}_{Q^{\prime}} \|$ is
the magnitude of the gravity vector $\mitbf{g}_{Q}$ at $Q^{\prime}$,
on the Geoid, and $\gamma_{Q} = \| \mitbf{\gamma}_{Q} \|$ is the
magnitude of the normal gravity vector $\mitbf{\gamma}_{Q}$ at $Q$,
on the reference ellipsoid (Fig. \ref{fig:surfaces}).
Notice that, by definition, the gravity anomaly depends on
longitude and latitude only and is not a function of height
\citep{barthelmes2013}. As a consequence, it is not possible to compute,
for example, the upward continuation of a gravity anomaly.
However, many authors in the literature have computed the upward
continuation of gravity anomalies. All these authors have
implicitly considered that the gravity anomaly is an approximation of
the gravity disturbance, which in turn can be represented by a
harmonic function that is allowed to be upward continued.

Different gravity anomalies can be calculated (e.g., Free-air and
Bouguer anomalies), depending on the corrections applied to
them. These corrections are usually called gravity reductions.
The Free-air anomaly, for example, is defined as follows
\citep{blakely1996, hofmann-wellenhof-moritz2005}:
\begin{equation}
\Delta g_{P}^{a}
= g_{P} - \left( \gamma_{Q} + \frac{\partial \gamma}{\partial h} \, H \right)
\: ,
\label{eq:free-air-anomaly}
\end{equation}
where $\frac{\partial \gamma}{\partial h} \approx -0.3086$ mGal/m is the
derivative of the normal gravity with respect to the geometric height $h$
and $H$ is the orthometric height (Fig. \ref{fig:surfaces}).
Notice that the term between parenthesis represents an
approximation of the normal gravity at the point $Q^{\prime}$ on the
Geoid. By using a similar approach, we can approximate the normal gravity
$\gamma_{P}$, at a point $P$ on the Earth's surface, so that the
gravity disturbance $\delta g_{P}$ (eq. \ref{eq:gravity-disturbance})
can be rewritten as follows:
\begin{equation}
\delta g_{P} \approx g_{P} -
\left( \gamma_{Q} + \frac{\partial \gamma}{\partial h} h \right) \: .
\label{eq:gravity-disturbance-approx}
\end{equation}
By inspection, one easily concludes that the absolute difference
between the approximated gravity disturbance $\delta g_{P}$
(eq. \ref{eq:gravity-disturbance-approx}), at a point $P$ on or close to
the Earth's surface, and the Free-air anomaly
$\Delta g_{P}^{a}$ (eq. \ref{eq:free-air-anomaly}), is given by:
\begin{equation}
\vert \delta g_{P} - \Delta g^{a}_{P} \vert \approx
\vert \frac{\partial \gamma}{\partial h} N \vert \: ,
\label{eq:difference-disturbance-free-air}
\end{equation}
where the geoidal undulation $N \approx h - H$ (Fig. \ref{fig:surfaces}) assumes
that the Geoid and the surface of the reference ellipsoid
are approximately parallel at $P$ and the surrounding area.
We know empirically that the geoidal undulation $N$ in the world
is $\approx \pm 1$ on the oceans and reaches a
maximum absolute value of $\approx 120$ m \citep[e.g.,][]{torge2012,
sanso_sideris2013}. In Brazil, for example, the geoidal undulation
reaches $\approx \pm 30$ m \citep{ibge_mapgeo2015}. Consequently, the
maximum absolute differences between gravity disturbance and
Free-air anomaly, according to eq. \ref{eq:difference-disturbance-free-air},
is $\approx 9.258$ mGal.

The approximations defined by eqs \ref{eq:gravity-disturbance-approx}
and \ref{eq:difference-disturbance-free-air} are commonly used
in geodesy to define the \textit{fundamental equation of physical
geodesy} \citep{hofmann-wellenhof-moritz2005}.
A similar approach can be used to show that the Bouguer anomaly
is an approximation of the terrain corrected gravity disturbance.
The Bouguer anomaly is commonly used by geophysicists as the
gravitational effect produced by the gravity sources.
Although this approximation is valid for most practical applications,
it is important to bear in mind not only the terminology
changes, but also the conceptual assumptions.

There was a certain lack of comprehension regarding the
geophysical meaning of gravity anomalies until the
mid 90's.
As properly pointed out by \citet{chapin1996} at that time,
``although the corrections which bring about a Bouguer
gravity anomaly are well established, the reasons for doing
them are not well understood. One cause of this common
misunderstanding is that the subject has been poorly presented in
many of the basic texts".
In his seminal book, \citet{blakely1996} brought some light
on the geophysical meaning of gravity anomalies from the
perspective of applied geophysics. \citet{blakely1996} correctly
defined gravity sources as density contrasts between the actual
internal density distribution of the Earth and the internal density
distribution of the normal Earth.
However, he did not stress that, by removing the normal gravity
evaluated on the ellipsoid from the gravity measured
on the Earth's surface, the remaining disturbing field will reflect
not only the effect produced by the gravity sources, but also a
small combination of gravitational and centrifugal effects.
This additional, non-harmonic and undesired effect is
simply due to the calculation of the normal gravity at a point
other than that were the gravity is measured.


\section{Mathematical description of the gravity disturbance at the TCS}

From eq. \ref{eq:gravity-disturbance-vector}, the gravity vector $\mitbf{g}_{i}$, at a point
$(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$ in the TCS (Fig. \ref{fig:TCS}b), can be represented by:
\begin{equation}
\mitbf{g}_{i} = \mitbf{\gamma}_{i} + \delta \mitbf{g}_{i} \: ,
\label{eq:gravity-vector-TCS}
\end{equation}
where $\mitbf{\gamma}_{i}$ and $\delta \mitbf{g}_{i}$
are, respectively, the normal gravity vector and the
gravity disturbance vector produced by the anomalous
masses at the point $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$.

The gravity $g_{i}$ can be approximated by a first order Taylor's
expansion as follows \citep{sanso_sideris2013}:
\begin{equation}
g_{i} \approx \gamma_{i} +
\hat{\mitbf{\gamma}}_{i}^{\top} \delta \mitbf{g}_{i} \: ,
\label{eq:gobs-approx}
\end{equation}
where $^{\top}$ denotes transposition,
$\hat{\mitbf{\gamma}}_{i} = -\hat{\mitbf{u}}_{i}$ is a unit
vector with the same direction as the normal gravity vector
$\mitbf{\gamma}_{i}$ at the point $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$, in the
topocentric Cartesian coordinate system (Fig. \ref{fig:TCS}b), and
$\hat{\mitbf{u}}_{i}$ is the unit vector $\hat{\mitbf{u}}$
(eq. \ref{eq:unit-vectors}) evaluated at the corresponding
point $(h_{i}, \varphi_{i}, \lambda_{i})$ in the
GGS (Fig. \ref{fig:GCS-GGS}).
This approximation can be made because, fortunately,
the condition $\gamma_{i} \gg \| \delta \mathbf{g}_{i} \|$
is met at all points located above or on the Earth's surface.
This approximation, which is known in geodesy \citep[e.g.,][]{sanso_sideris2013},
is largely used in applied geophysics for representing
total-field anomalies \citep[e.g.,][]{blakely1996}.
Notice that, in local- or regional-gravity studies, the unit
vector $\hat{\mitbf{\gamma}}_{i}$ (eq. \ref{eq:gobs-approx})
may be considered constant throughout the study area and
parallel to the $z$ axis of the TCS (Fig. \ref{fig:TCS}b).
By using the approximation defined in eq.
\ref{eq:gobs-approx}, the gravity disturbance
(eq. \ref{eq:gravity-disturbance}) can be rewritten as
follows
\begin{equation}
\delta g_{i} \approx \hat{\mitbf{\gamma}}_{P}^{\top} \delta \mitbf{g}_{i} \: ,
\label{eq:gravity-disturbance-approx-TCS}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\mitbf{\gamma}}_{P}$ represents the unit vector with
the same direction as the normal gravity vector $\mitbf{\gamma}_{P}$
at the origin $P$ of the TCS (Fig. \ref{fig:TCS}b).
This equation shows that the gravity disturbance $\delta g_{i}$ (eq. \ref{eq:gravity-disturbance}) is different from the magnitude
of the gravity disturbance vector $\delta \mitbf{g}_{i}$
produced by the gravity sources. Rather, it represents the
component of $\delta \mitbf{g}_{i}$ on the direction of the normal
gravity vector \citep{hofmann-wellenhof-moritz2005, sanso_sideris2013}.

In the TCS (Fig. \ref{fig:TCS}b),
the gravity disturbance $\delta g_{i}$ (eq. \ref{eq:gravity-disturbance-approx-TCS})
can be defined as the $z$-component of the gravitational attraction exerted by
the gravity sources at the point $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$.
As a consequence, the gravity disturbance produced by
a gravity source can be represented by the following harmonic function:
\begin{equation}
d_{i} = \partial_{z} \phi_{i} \: ,
\label{eq:gz-local}
\end{equation}
where $\partial_{z} \phi_{i}$ is the first
derivative, evaluated at the point $(x_{i},y_{i},z_{i})$, of the function
\begin{equation}
\phi(x,y,z) = \int\int\limits_{v}\int
\frac{c_{g} \, G \, \Delta\rho(x^{\prime}, y^{\prime}, z^{\prime}) \: dv}
{\sqrt{(x - x^{\prime})^{2} +
(y - y^{\prime})^{2} + (z - z^{\prime})^{2}}} \: ,
\label{eq:phi}
\end{equation}
with respect to the variable $z$. Is this integral,
$G$ is the Newtonian constant of gravitation (in $m^{3} kg^{-1} s^{-2}$),
$c_{g} = 10^{5}$ is a constant factor transforming from $m s^{-2}$
to milligal (mGal), $\Delta\rho(x^{\prime}, y^{\prime}, z^{\prime})$
is the density contrast (in $kg / m^{3}$) at a point
$(x^{\prime}, y^{\prime}, z^{\prime})$ within
the volume $v$ of the gravity source and the integration is conducted
over $x^{\prime}$, $y^{\prime}$ and $z^{\prime}$.
This equation can be easily generalized for the case
of multiple gravity sources.

Practically all the literature about gravity modelling
use the quantity $d_{i}$ (eq. \ref{eq:gz-local})
to represent the gravity anomaly produced by
gravity sources \citep[e.g.,][]{blakely1996}.
Consequently, almost all geophysicists use the gravity
anomaly as an approximation of the gravity disturbance
produced by the gravity sources. Notice that $d_{i}$
(eq. \ref{eq:gz-local}) does not depend on the
height with respect to the Geoid (orthometric height).
Rather, it depends on the relative position
of the observation points $(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})$ with respect to
the gravity sources in the TCS (Fig. \ref{fig:TCS}b).
It is important to notice that, contrary to what is written in
some basic texts, gravimeters do not measure the quantity
$d_{i}$ (eq. \ref{eq:gz-local}).


\section{Conclusions}

We debate the conceptual differences between the gravity
disturbance and the gravity anomaly.
Our reasoning suggests that the gravity disturbance is the
more appropriated quantity for representing the gravity
effect produced by the gravity sources.
In summary, we point out that:

\begin{enumerate}
%\renewcommand{\theenumi}{(\arabic{enumi})}
\renewcommand{\theenumii}{\alph{enumii}}

\item Almost all interpretation techniques assume, implicitly or
directly, that the gravity data is harmonic (e.g.,
upward/downward continuation,
data processing with equivalent layer,
conversions between gravity and magnetic data,
computation of vertical derivatives via Fourier and Hilbert
transforms). As a consequence, they implicitly or directly assume that
the gravity data approximate the gravity disturbance.

\item Almost all forward modelling techniques compute
the vertical component of the gravitational attraction
exerted by the gravity sources at the observation points.
Notice that the gravity anomaly requires the computation of gravity
on the Geoid, which is generally within the topographic masses.
Hence, almost all these techniques in fact compute the gravity
disturbance.

\item The gravity anomaly is defined as the difference between
the gravity on the Geoid and the normal gravity on the reference
ellipsoid, both at the same geodetic latitude and longitude.
Consequently, the gravity anomaly is a function of
the geodetic latitude and longitude only and cannot
be calculated at arbitrary heights. On the other hand,
the gravity disturbance can be computed at arbitrary points
outside the sources. Then, computing the upward
continuation of gravity anomalies implicitly assumes
that they approximate the gravity disturbance.

\item In Brazil, the maximum difference between the gravity
disturbance (on or close to the Earth's surface) and the Free-air
anomaly reaches $\approx 9.3$ mGal.

\end{enumerate}

The principal theoretical implication of this study is that,
although the gravity anomaly may be used as a good approximation of
the gravitational effect produced by the sources for most practical applications,
the more appropriated quantity for gravity modelling is the
gravity disturbance. We stress that, more important than the
terminology changes, the researchers must bear in mind the
conceptual assumptions used in gravity modelling.

    \caption{Schematic representation of the Geocentric Cartesian System (GCS) and the Geocentric Geodetic System (GGS). The GCS has the $Z$-axis coincident with the mean Earth's rotational axis,
    the $X$-axis pointing to the Greenwich meridian and the $Y$-axis
    directed so as to obtain a right-handed system. The GGS is      defined by an oblate ellipsoid with semi-minor axis $b$,
    coincident with the $Z$-axis of GCS, and a semi-major
    axis $a$. In this coordinate system, the position of a point is
    determined by the geometric height $h$, geodetic latitude
    $\varphi$ and longitude $\lambda$.
    The Earth's center of mass is represented
    by $O$, $P$ represents a point $(h_{P}, \varphi_{P}, \lambda_{P})$ and $P^{\prime}$ its projection onto the plane $XY$
    (Equatorial plane). The plane containing $O$, $P$ and
    $P^{\prime}$ is represented in gray in (a) and (b).
    The unit vectors $\hat{\mitbf{u}}_{P}$, $\hat{\mitbf{v}}_{P}$ and
    $\hat{\mitbf{w}}_{P}$ define three mutually orthogonal
    directions at $P$ (eq. \ref{eq:unit-vectors}).
    In (b), $Q$ represents a point $(h_{Q}, \varphi_{Q}, \lambda_{Q})$,
    which is the projection of $P$ onto the reference ellipsoid, at
    the same latitude and longitude ($\varphi_{Q} = \varphi_{P}$ and $\lambda_{Q} = \lambda_{P}$).}

    \caption{(a) Schematic representation of the gravity vector
    $\mitbf{g}_{P}$, normal gravity vector $\mitbf{\gamma}_{P}$,
    gravity disturbance vector $\delta \mitbf{g}_{P}$
    (eq. \ref{eq:gravity-disturbance-vector}) and unit vector
    $\hat{\mitbf{u}}_{P}$ (eq. \ref{eq:unit-vectors}) at a point
    $P$.
    (b) Schematic representation of a topocentric Cartesian
    coordinate system with origin at a point $P$. The axes $x$
    and $y$ are parallel to the unit vectors $\hat{\mitbf{v}}_{P}$
    and $\hat{\mitbf{w}}_{P}$ (eq. \ref{eq:unit-vectors} and
    Fig. \ref{fig:GCS-GGS}), respectively. On the other hand, the $z$ axis is opposite to the unit vector $\hat{\mitbf{u}}_{P}$ (eq.
    \ref{eq:unit-vectors} and Fig. \ref{fig:GCS-GGS}) and points downward. The gray plane shown in (b) is the same gray plane
    shown in Fig. \ref{fig:GCS-GGS}.}

        $\mitbf{g}_{P}$, normal gravity vector $\mitbf{\gamma}_{P}$,
        gravity disturbance vector $\delta \mitbf{g}_{P}$
        (eq. \ref{eq:gravity-disturbance-vector}), unit vector
        $\hat{\mitbf{u}}_{P}$ (eq. \ref{eq:unit-vectors}) at a point $P$
        on the surface of the Earth, gravity vector $\mitbf{g}_{Q^{\prime}}$
        at a point $Q^{\prime}$ on the Geoid, normal gravity vector
        $\mitbf{\gamma}_{Q}$ at a point $Q$ on the reference ellipsoid,
        geometric height $h$, orthometric height $H$ and geoidal undulation
        $N$ \citep{heiskanen-moritz1967}.
        The dashed line passing through
        $Q$, $Q^{\prime}$ and $P$ is normal to the
        surface of the reference ellipsoid at $Q$. This figure
        shows a commonly used approximation in which the ellipsoid
        surface and the Geoid are represented as parallel surfaces,
        so that $h \approx H + N$.}
